# User Story US0000B

## Summary

**As a** user

**I want to** be able to run `tcbasic` on a variety of operating systems and hardware

**So that** I have the same execution environment everywhere for my BASIC programs.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** any operating system with a C compiler

**When** anyone compiles the source and runs the resulting binary

**Then** the program shall use the minimum number of C library functions/features.

## Additional Information

Create an abstraction layer for i/o and memory management. Build needed features
(e.g. string length function) on top of that. This provides one file with
the abstraction layer. Any portability fixes / work-a-rounds should go in that
file. Add header, function, and symbol to `configure.ac` for this layer so that
it's easy for future developers to add portability fixes.
