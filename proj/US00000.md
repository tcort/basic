# User Story US00000

## Summary

**As a** developer

**I want to** have user stories

**So that** I can do project planning and later software archaeology.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** the project repository

**When** I look in the `proj/` directory

**Then** I see a collection of stories along with a template.

## Additional Information

Story IDs should consist of 5 hex digits. That's enough for 1,048,576 stories
while also being easy to type, sort, and remember.

Remember to reference user stories in commits.
