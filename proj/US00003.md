# User Story US00003

## Summary

**As a** user

**I want to** see what has changed since the last version without going through
all of `ChangeLog`

**So that** I can learn of new features and important changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** a source directory

**When** I look in it 

**Then** I should see a `NEWS` file with important changes since the last release.

## Additional Information

Call it `NEWS` for GNU compatibility.
