# User Story US0000A

## Summary

**As a** developer and user

**I want to** be able to configure and compile the software in an automated way

**So that** I don't have to manually run compile commands

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** a source directory

**When** I follow the instructions in `INSTALL`

**Then** I should get a working binary installed.

## Additional Information

Use autotools. Source code is `src`. This is a first pass. Do the minimum.
Worry about test suites, man page generation, etc later.
