# User Story US0000C

## Summary

**As a** developer

**I want to** be able to test existing code

**So that** I can ensure future changes don't break existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** a source tree

**When** I run `make check`

**Then** some tests run to ensure changes having broken anything.

## Additional Information

Add some unit tests for now. Defer functional tests until there is some
functionality to test.
