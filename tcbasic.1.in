.SH NAME
tcbasic \- a small BASIC Interpreter written in C
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcbasic
[\fIfilename\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
tcbasic implements a small subset of BASIC in portable C. If the user specifies
a filename on the command line or pipes data to tcbasic, the results will be
written to standard out. If no file is specified, an interactive mode is
started where a user can interact with the BASIC system directly.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \-?            \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a helpful message and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR                 \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit
.SH STATEMENTS
.TP
\fBREM remark\fR
Remark has no effect on the execution of the program
and acts as a comment to the developer. The remark can contain
any character.
.TP
\fBPRINT list\fR
Prints the contents of 'list' to the console where 'list' is a
comma separated list of one or more quoted strings, expressions,
and/or variables.
.TP
\fBIF expression relop expression THEN statement\fR
Evaluates both 'expression's and compares them using relational
operator 'relop'. If the relation is true, then the statement
will be executed. Otherwise, the statement is skipped.
.TP
\fBGOTO expression\fR
Evaluates 'expression' and jumps to the corresponding line number.
.TP
\fBINPUT var_list\fR
Given a comma separated list of 1 or more variables, this command
will prompt the user to enter a comma separated list of expressions.
The value of each expression will be assigned to each corresponding
variable.
.TP
\fBGOSUB expression\fR
Evaluates 'expression' and jumps to the corresponding line number
after saving the current line number.
.TP
\fBRETURN\fR
Returns control to the line after the last 'GOSUB' call.
.TP
\fBLET var = expression\fR
Assigns the value of expression to variable 'var' where 'var' is
a single character variable name in the range from A to Z.
.TP
\fBEND\fR
Ends the execution of the program.
.TP
\fBSTOP\fR
Exits the interpreter.
.TP
\fBRANDOMIZE\fR
Re-seeds the random number generator, causing RND to return a different
sequence of random numbers.
.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
\fBRND\fR
Returns a random number in the range [0,1). The same sequence of numbers is
returned in each program run. Use the RANDOMIZE statement to generate
different sequences in each program run.
.TP
\fBSIN (expression)\fR
Returns the sine of the given expression (measured in radians).
.TP
\fBCOS (expression)\fR
Returns the cosine of the given expression (measured in radians).
.TP
\fBTAN (expression)\fR
Returns the tangent of the given expression (measured in radians).
.TP
\fBCOT (expression)\fR
Returns the cotangent of the given expression (measured in radians).
.TP
\fBATN (expression)\fR
Returns the arctangent of the given expression (measured in radians).
.TP
\fBEXP (expression)\fR
Returns e to the power of the given expression.
.TP
\fBLOG (expression)\fR
Returns the natural logarithm of of the given expression.
.TP
\fBABS (expression)\fR
Returns the absolute value of the given expression.
.TP
\fBSQR (expression)\fR
Returns the square root of the given expression.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBCLEAR\fR
Clears the program from memory and sets all variables to 0.
.TP
\fBLIST\fR
Prints the current program.
.TP
\fBRUN\fR
Executes the current program.
